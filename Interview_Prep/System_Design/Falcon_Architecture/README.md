- **Kimble PSA, Salesforce, and Azure Blob Storage** trigger events in **Azure Data Factory** when data is updated or created.
- **Azure Data Factory** performs **data transformation** to convert raw data into a structured format.
- After transformation, the data is stored in a **Database**.
- **Azure Data Factory** sends a message to **RabbitMQ**, indicating that the data has been updated and aggregation needs to be performed.
- **RabbitMQ** queues this message, which is then picked up by the **Aggregator Service** (written in Java).
- The **Aggregator Service** precomputes complex aggregations and stores the aggregated data back in the **Database**.
- The **Aggregator Service** also writes the aggregated data to a **Cache** using a write-through caching technique, ensuring quick data retrieval.
- When a **Node.js Server** receives a request, it first checks the **Cache** for the required data.
- If the data is not found in the **Cache**, the **Node.js Server** fetches it from the **Database**.
- Finally, the **Node.js Server** serves the requested data to the **Host** through a REST API.
